    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles dating to the 14th
      century in Italy and medieval England. The traditional macaroni and cheese
      is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce
      pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix.[4] The cheese is often
      first incorporated into a BÃ©chamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which
      is then added to the pasta. In the United States and Canada, it is
      considered a comfort food.[

      Make the Cheese Sauce: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium
      heat. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture
      is lightly golden and bubbly. Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there
      are no lumps. Continue to whisk constantly until the sauce thickens, about
      5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until
      melted and smooth. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and optional
      seasonings like mustard powder or cayenne pepper to taste.
    </li>

      Combine and Serve: Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce, stirring
      until the pasta is evenly coated. Serve hot, optionally garnished with
      extra cheese or breadcrumbs for added texture.
